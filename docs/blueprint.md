# **App Name**: TaskFlow

## Core Features:

- Task Input Form: Input form for task name, duration, and dependencies using dropdowns. Validation for data entry.
- Gantt Chart: Interactive Gantt chart visualization with the critical path highlighted. Implement zoom and drag functionalities. Visual comparison between planned and actual progress.
- MPM Diagram: Visualization of tasks and dependencies with earliest/latest dates shown on hover.
- PERT Diagram: Visualization of task durations. Dashed lines to indicate non-essential tasks.
- View Switching: Toggle between Gantt, MPM and PERT views using tab buttons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calm blue (#3498db) for the header and main interactive elements.
- Secondary color: Use a light grey (#f2f2f2) for background and card elements.
- Accent: Use a vibrant green (#2ecc71) to highlight the critical path and interactive elements.
- Use a clear, modular layout with well-defined sections for input forms, diagrams, and summary data.
- Use simple, clear icons from a library like FontAwesome for task dependencies, durations, and other controls.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., a fade-in effect) when switching between different chart views or updating data.
